# NOTES

The notes contained in this folder can be about various topics and from very different quality. We follow the believe that sketching out the wanted API before starting to implement it helps with
staying focues when doing so. Also it is helpful to get a better plan on what is needed for now because people often feel overwhelmed and don't really know where to start. Specing out stuff or 
just scribble something about the general idea/concept often helps to overcome this first hurdle. 

Things you can expect to see here:

- Crude example use cases of planned APIs
- Notes of certain concepts, techniques or algorithms (I personally prefer to do those on good, old paper but I will move them to here for tracking and versioning)
- Cheatsheets or other smaller reference materials
- Diagrams, sketches, etc. about techniques, ideas or concepts

What you will not see here:

- Documentation (there will be a distinct folder at some point)
- Highly technical documents or detailed specifications
